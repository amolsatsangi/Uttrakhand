                <p>Uttarakhand has a highly varied topography, with snow-covered peaks, glaciers, deep canyons, roaring streams, beautiful lakes, and a few patches of dusty plains in the south.
                     Some of the highest mountains in the world are found in Uttarakhand. Most notably, these include Nanda Devi, which is the second highest peak in India, Kamet, and Badrinath. <span class="hidden-xs">Uttarakhand can be divided into several physiographic zones.The northern zone, popularly known as the Himadri, contains segments of the Zaskar and the Great Himalaya ranges.Adjacent to and south of the Great Himalayas is a zone containing the Lesser Himalayas, known popularly as the Himachal.To the south of the Himachal is a stretch of the Siwalik Range. </span>
